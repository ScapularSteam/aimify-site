                <p class="intro-text">Say goodbye to paper scoresheets and clunky plotting interfaces, and say hello to a clean and modern UI, cloud backups and automatic scoring using your phone's camera.</p>

                <h2>AI automated scoring</h2>
                <p>Aimify will harness the power of YoloV8 to train an instance segmentation model on a library of images of target faces and arrows.</p>
                <p>The ability to detect the rings of the target, known as scoring zones, in addition to arrows, enables the ability to determine which score an arrow should recieve, based on which zone it occludes.</p>
                <p>This, in theory, will enable automated scoring, where a user can simply point their phone at the target using on-screen guides for the best results, and have the scores automatically inputted. This will reduce the time taken inbetween ends, as this approach will be faster than inputting scores by hand, with the added benefit of plotting, a feature that is often subjective and time-consuming.</p>

                <h2>Clean user interface</h2>
                <p>Aimify's UI will be built using the latest frameworks and design guidelines, including React Native, Paper, and Material V3</p>
                <p>This will ensure a minimialistic UI, allowing you to focus on what truely matters, shooting. In addition, using React Native opens up the app to every major platform, including Android, IOS and even Linux</p>

                <h2>Free and Open Source</h2>
                <p>At this time, Aimify is intended to be released as an open source project to make it as widespread as possible, with all files being released on Github for ease of acsess in addition to major app stores.</p>
                <p>This being said, the server-side software required for running and hosting competitions will be released as free for non-commercial use, with a small licencing fee for buisnesses and organisations.</p>
